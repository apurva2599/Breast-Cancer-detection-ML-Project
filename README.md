# Breast-Cancer-detection-ML-Project

Breast Cancer Detection using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
This project develops a machine learning model to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign. The primary objective is to create a reliable predictive tool to assist in early detection and diagnosis. The model is built using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, a robust algorithm for classification tasks.

Methodology
The project follows a standard machine learning pipeline:

Data Preprocessing: The Breast Cancer Detection Classification Master.csv dataset was loaded and preprocessed, followed by a 70/30 split into training and testing sets. Features were scaled using StandardScaler to ensure uniform contribution to the model.

Model Implementation: A linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC) was trained on the preprocessed training data.

Performance and Results
The model achieved high accuracy and a low false negative rate, which is critical for medical applications.

Accuracy: 93.57%

Conclusion
The model's 93.57% accuracy and minimal false negative rate (3) highlight its strong potential for real-world application. This project demonstrates the effective use of machine learning to solve complex medical problems, providing a valuable tool for healthcare professionals to make more informed decisions and potentially improve patient outcomes.
